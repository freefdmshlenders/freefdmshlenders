12.4 million payday loans were taken out by 1.7 million individuals. That suggests an average of seven loans per borrower, but does not take into account payday borrowers who borrow from multiple stores or where different people from the same household take out multiple payday loans.

When the California Department of Corporations did a one-time study in 2007, it found that 1.01 million families accounted for 10 million payday loans â€“ an average of nearly 10 loans per family. Further, payday lenders reported that "more than 80 percent of their business is attributed to repeat customers." The reality is that triple-digit interest rates trap borrowers in a long-term cycle of repeat loans from which it is difficult to recover.
